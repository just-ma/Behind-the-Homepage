# Behind the Homepage

First impressions are important, so I invested a good amount of time and planning into my homepage. I initially had no intention of coding since my experience in front-end web development was near zero. However, once I had the vision of draggable windows that showcased my work, I just couldn't let it go.

I watched tutorials, read forums, and learned enough HTML, CSS, and Javascript to shape the front page into what it is now. The process was surprisingly exhilarating, as I got to hop between both programming and design. One by one, windows were animated and buttons were implemented, until the ingredients came together into a perfectly-baked cake.

This is one of the few projects completed solely by me and probably the one I'm most proud of. In the process, I grew to enjoy web development and design, something I'm excited to explore further in future projects.

Animations can be viewed on the Film & Animation page.
